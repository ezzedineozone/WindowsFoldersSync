# Windows Folders Sync Application
This is my first ever application project, made Using c#, the wpf framework , and SQLite.
BackupApplication (Made mostly for personal use, but decided to release it) to sync up folders across my local machine, currently in very early alpha version, bugs and crashes are expected!
# How to use :
-The first box represents the source folder, here you can click on the three dots to the right to select a folder to be your source, it could be anywhere on your pc!  
-The second box represents the destination folder, here you can choose the folder that you want to sync up your source folder to! (Note: folder has to be empty)  
-Clicking on add after specifying the source and the destination will add your config as a saveslot, said slot is represended using the scrollviewer to the right hand side, where you
can manage them, they are represented by buttons, each button containing the number of the order the slots were added in.  
-Clicking on a slot will replace the textboxes's contents with their corresponding data from the slot itself.  
-To modify a save slot, simply click on it from the scrollviewer, and change the source/destination.  
-To delete a slot, simply choose the slot you want to delete, and clear out both the Source and the Detination text boxes using the "X" buttons.

# Future plans
-Automated Runs:
one of the future plans is to give the user the ability to set a date and time and frequency for backups to run automatically.
(do not expect any updates soon as of the date of writing this (4/13/2022) as im moving on to other projects but will occasionally come back to this if bugs are discovered)
